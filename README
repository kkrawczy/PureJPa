Pure JPA Project using only Java SE.
Application will try to connect to H2 database, create db structure and create one user entity.
We need to start H2 database before. To do it we can use H2 server that will be in maven dependencies:
cd ~/.m2/repository/com/h2database/h2/1.4.190
java -cp h2-1.4.190.jar org.h2.tools.Server
After that web console will be opened and we can start the database. We need to start Generic H2 (Server) with the values defined in the persistence.xml.
Then we can start the application:
mvn clean install
Test will be run and data will be added to the database.

To start db automatically in memory we need to change jdbc.url to "jdbc:h2:mem/test"
